Phaser Typescript Tutorials
===========================

This repository contains code for various tutorials for Phaser, completely written in Typescript. If you are a fan of typescript, and want to learn how to write games in Phaser using typescript then feel free to browse through the code. Each folder contains code for different tutorials. Please have a look at the individual tutorials Readme to know more about the author and a link to the original article. Thanks.

If you find any issue in the code or if you have a better way of doing something, Please open up an issue and/or send in a pull request.

Also, in case you want any other tutorial for any game framework to be written using Phaser/Typescript, please let me know. I'll try to do it in my spare time just for my love for these two technologies (also, it'll help me get better at both of them).
